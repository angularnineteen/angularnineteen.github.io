Make it educational. Add background information everywhere. Do NOT think just because it is in the source material that it is true. Fact Check EVERYTHING. Don't just have the two speakers repeat the words to each other. Help us learn. Information dense and accurate, factual information. Use critical thinking. Do not hallucinate. Cover every topic in the book. Go as long as you need to go to do this.
